# The DMV

## Iteration 1 Reflection

### 1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.

I ran RSpec on all of the tests and then worked through the first listed test each time. I worked first to understand the process the test was looking for and then checked all of the variables and methods to see what wasn't translating.

### 2. What was hard about working with code you did not write?

I had to first understand what the code was attempting to do and what the tests were set up for before I could debug it, whereas when the tests were written by myself I already have some idea of what I'm looking for.

### 3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?

What the code was doing became apparent to me faster than I though it would. It was also nice to have something broken and then fix one tiny thing and it all worked.
